				<h1>Adventure Time!</h1>
				<p><a href="http://www.projectpixelpress.com/adventure-time-game-wizard" target="_blank">Adventure Time: Game Wizard</a> was the 
					first game I worked on at Pixel Press, in collaboration with <a href="http://grumpyfacestudios.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Grumpyface 
					Studios</a> and Cartoon Network. Following in the footsteps of <a href="http://www.projectpixelpress.com/floors" target="_blank">Floors</a> 
					(the game that launched Pixel Press via Kickstarter), Game Wizard is a 2D platformer with a substantial level editor. As with Floors, you 
					can draw your level designs on graph paper using specific symbols, and use your mobile device's camera to "scan" your drawings into the game. 
				</p>

				</div>
				<p>Pixel Press handled the level editor and game sharing aspects, while Grumpyface was responsible for gameplay and the vast majority 
					of the game's art. I don't know who it was between Grumpyface and Cartoon Network, but someone is responsible for recruiting
					"Weird Al" Yankovic's vocal talents to bring the antagonist "Doodle Wizard" to life, which was just lovely.

				<h1>My Role</h1>
				<p> I was fresh out of college coming into this project. Not like 1st-choice-loaf-of-bread-at-the-grocery-store fresh, but still, 
					pretty fresh. I was mostly tasked with bug fixes and optimization to prevent crashes due to memory pressure. The tasks 
					where I had more authorship pertained to the level editor. Specifically, the multi-touch pan and zoom controls, and efficiently 
					rendering in-game art in the editor viewport. I'll refrain from posting any code samples or additional details here, being the 
					distant past with proprietary code and all. It was a fun project to be a part of, and a nice way to kick off a career in game 
					development.
