				<h1>A&nbsplong time&nbspago</h1>
				<p>Ah, <a href="http://starwars.bloxelsbuilder.com/" target="_blank">Bloxels Star Wars</a>. Surprised at the existence of a Star Wars game 
					outside of EA? At Pixel Press, we were surprised to be making it. At the height of our 3-year partnership with Mattel, 
					they graciously worked us into the Star Wars universe via their contacts at Lucasfilm. It was a very ambitious project 
					given our time frame of less than a year, small team, and augmented reality companion product.

					The game was released in January of 2018, and unreleased in January of 2020. The nebulous nature of the same forces allowing 
					this project to exist ultimately led to its early retirement. The project never received any updates, though I would have 
					loved to revisit it. From the experience and growth of our team through its development, I feel a future for Bloxels Star 
					Wars may have been bright.

				<h1>My Role</h1>
				<p>The work I'm most proud of on this project is the implementation of the character controllers. Our newly hired animator Aaron 
					and I quickly discovered we worked well together, and were able to iterate a lot to give all 8 playable characters a unique 
					feel. Another layer I'd brought to this was integrating the character controller parameters with a spreadsheet on Google Drive. 
					This way, our level designer could adjust them in builds for his early drafts, and we'd routinely come together for consensus 
					as the project matured. 
				</p>
				<p>Throughout the early months, I was in charge of the technical development of the AR product, a branded and more refined version 
					of the original Bloxels board. This mostly involved requesting and analyzing 3D models and physical prototypes from Mattel, 
					providing feedback to make sure the final product had strong AR tracking features and that we had reliable color classification 
					for the 8 different block colors.
