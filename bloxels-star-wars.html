				<p>Ah, <a href="http://starwars.bloxelsbuilder.com/">Bloxels Star Wars</a>. Surprised at the existence of a Star Wars game 
					outside of EA? At Pixel Press, we were surprised to be making it. At the height of our 3-year partnership with Mattel, 
					they graciously worked us into the Star Wars universe via their contacts at Lucasfilm. It was a very ambitious project 
					given our time frame of less than a year, small team, and the development of an augmented reality companion product.
				</br></br>
					The game was released in January of 2018, and unreleased in January of 2020. The nature of the same nebulous forces allowing 
					this project to exist ultimately led to its early retirement. The project never received any updates, though I would have 
					loved to revisit it. With the experience and growth of our team through its development, I feel a future for Bloxels Star 
					Wars may have been bright, indeed. Alas, I only hope that this is a worthy testament to its promise. 
				</br></br>
					And an opportunity to show off, of course. I'm trying to make myself look good here. It's my website.
