	<p>Since it ended up being the most complex, let's talk about Boba Fett's state machine. Over the course of development, 
		we'd occasionally check in with Lucasfilm for approvals. This often led to some unexpected mandates. For instance, Boba's 
		helmet antenna was required to be on the right side of his helmet, meaning I could no longer simply flip the sprite to face 
		left or right for any of his animations. I'm eternally grateful similar observations weren't made regarding our 
		melee characters' dominant hands. That said, I would have been really excited about such attention to detail given more time.

<div class="paragraph-container">
	<p>Attack animation states were called explicitly via code, but transitions among states were mostly handed by conditions on 
		animation parameters. These conditions were defined via Unity's visual tools in the editor, with the parameters updated by 
		control input and each character's physics data. Each state is a container for blend trees swapping the animation clips on 
		a more granular level.

<div class="paragraph-container">
	<p>Blend trees operated on whether Boba was on the ground, his vertical velocity, and which direction he was facing. 
		When Mecanim transitions between clips via a blend tree, the time lapsed in one animation clip carries over to the next. 
		For example, if you were shoot your blaster just before a transition from rising to falling, the shooting animation during 
		the rise would be completed by the animation for a shot while falling. Building our state machines this way helped avoid
		jarring transitions and interruptions.
